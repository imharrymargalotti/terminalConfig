# terminalConfig
the last time I manually configure an environment :)

1. okay...you gotta install brew manually first. 
2. chmod +x terminal-config.sh (or just execute it)
3. ./terminal-config.sh (or just execute it)
4. 'CMD+,' in iterm -> profiles -> import profile json from repo


terminal-config.sh will install a bunch of command line utility that I use often. 


iterm-profile uses a github dark color scheme 
KEYBINDS: 
ALT+Space - vertically splits to a second terminal
CTRL+Space - navigate one vertical terminal right
CMD+W - this is default, but it closes a vertical pane
